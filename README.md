# Intelligent-Systems-PCA-for-Classification

The objective was to develop an understanding of k means and neural networks clustering as well as principal component analysis for classification. Here we use a unsupervised learning method known as clustering which can identify bias, variance, and dependance among features. Kmeans clustering more specifically is used for vector quantization, by the partition of data around their closest centroid, similar to nearest neighbor. Also used was PCA, a tool used to analyze complex multivariate data sets to yield common trends, by first splitting the data into smaller groups and find similarities (a bit like clustering!).
